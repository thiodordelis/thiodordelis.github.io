Developed back in 2006, it was a redesign of an old(but still functional) spare car parts website.

Due to system requirements, vanilla PHP was used and a database tweaks/optimizations were made to load hundreds of entries in just a few milliseconds.

An autocomplete plug-in was developed from scratch, reassigned proper indexes in MySQL and continuous support/maintenance was agreed. Administration panel was also included with basic CRUD operations and some more complex features that cannot be disclosed.

This ~~is~~was my first SaaS attempt started in late 2017 - a wedding website builder(now terminated).

Everything is made from scratch with Laravel and MariaDB and it is composed of 3 distinct parts: the landing page(Bulma CSS), client admin panel and the client's wedding webpage.

Jolly Moments runs on a relative small size VPS (1GB RAM) and it's fully optimized(Nginx+MariaDB) to run without any lag or latency.

One day with nothing to do, I decided to make a "stupid" game in 3-4 days and Hi-Low for Android was born!

Fast forward 3 years later, this game without any promotion or marketing, got about 13k downloads, featured in a few countries and generated some cash from ads.

For it's standards it was a success!

The original Hi-Lo game was coded without any 2D framework, I used native Java which had it's flows.

Since I had the urge and time to learn something new, I rewrote it using libGDX and the results were impressive.

With the deluxe version, I managed to get higher framerate, smooth UI and smaller APK size, plus the foundation was laid for more features in later releases.
